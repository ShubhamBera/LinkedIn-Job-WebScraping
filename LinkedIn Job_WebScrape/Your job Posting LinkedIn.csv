With over 40 years of semiconductor process control experience, chipmakers around the globe rely on KLA to ensure that their fabs ramp next-generation devices to volume production quickly and cost-effectively. KLA's Global Products Group (GPG), which is responsible for creating all of KLA’s metrology and inspection products, is looking for forward-thinking research scientists, software engineers, application development engineers, and senior product technology process engineers to join our team and enable the movement towards advanced chip design.    KLA advanced computing Labs’ (ACL) mission in India is to deliver advanced parallel computing research and software architectures for AI + HPC + Cloud solutions to accelerate KLA’s product performance. This team explores high-risk approaches, pioneering technologies, and novel methods to accelerate KLA’s algorithms and contribute to KLA’s HPC technology roadmap. We engage leading thinkers in academia, industry and KLA’s business units to create innovative parallel computing methods to enable KLA’s business growth.      KLA is hiring engineers for its Advanced Computing Labs in Chennai, India. KLA ACL is at our new research center in the IITM, Research Park. The goal of the center is to conduct computational research in parallel and distributed sub-systems and deploy them to KLA’s advanced semi-conductor platforms that are used for inspection and metrology tasks in leading fabs. These efforts are part of a larger global initiative at KLA to scale up its AI + HPC + cloud infrastructure.    As part of this elite R&D team, the job entails understanding core algorithms that have to expressed in various parallel computing constructs particularly HPC accelerators such as FPGAs. The first step in optimizing will be to theoretically model break-down of our AI algorithms and model it in terms of available bandwidth, computational FLOPS etc.  Historically FPGAs have been programmed in HW RTL languages such VHDL and Verilog. In these projects, one of the main areas of research are to see if newer HLS (Higher Level Synthesis) tools sets such as Xilinx’s Vivaldo/Vitis that allow computation to be expressed in the C/C++ language can be competitive with RTL. The project requires engineers with a very strong background in traditional FPGA programming to map those computations into the HLS C++ language and explore to see how much performance is achieved relative to RTL while enabling significant programmer productivity.  While the initial focus of the team will be on lower level module productivity using Vivaldo/Vitis toolsets, it is also the intent to see if one can use higher level programming models such as SYCL/DPC++/TriSycl to achieve similar performance.      The position also requires a person with significant communication, initiative and the ability to navigate from relatively high-level requirements to low level computational models.    Any prior experience in KLA domains such as wafer inspection coupled with programming in CUDA or AVX will be a very plus. Additionally, any experience in optimizing large scale signal or computer vision algorithms would also be a major plus. It  Experience in large scale distributed HPC systems, proven experience in Docker and Container orchestration and any expertise in AI Frameworks (TensorFlow) will also be welcome.  Finally a strong background in Modern C++ concepts (C++ 11 through C++ 17), STL library would also be a way to stand out from the crowd.    Show more"

The workflow starts with biopsy, then tissues are fed into tissue processing instruments in the diagnostic workflow. The tissue processors prepare the tissues for further processing by subjecting the tissues to one or more tissue processing protocols based on tissue types and other parameters. Later the tissues are stained so that cancerous cells can be clearly differentiated from the normal ones through pathology imaging devices. It’s very important, after the diagnostic stage in the workflow, to protect the tissues for several years based on the regulatory requirements; Cover-slippers, yet another instrument, from Core Histology covers the tissue slides with the glass covers automatically and precisely.
